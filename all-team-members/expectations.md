# Expectations

{% hint style="warning" %}
When moderating on our server, we have expectations of you as you represent our Discord-partnered server and the Warframe brand.
{% endhint %}

* Maintain a high level of professionalism and be calm when talking to users or giving punishments.
* Communicate with troublemakers in PM, but also document warnings with the !warn command
* No rude remarks, subtle jabs at admins or mods, sexual jokes, harassment, bullying or disrespect
* To ensure that you’re up-to-date on troublesome users that may require punishment in the future, please check \#action-log at least once a day
* Deal with moderation issues independently and don’t constantly pass off issues to other Moderators. It’s fine to ask for help if you don’t know what to do
* Don’t punish users based on actions or events in other servers. However, if it’s considerably serious, consider informing an Administrator of it
* Avoid spamming channels with inappropriate memes, pictures, jokes
* Avoid being biased or rude towards a user due to "cliques" formed, or because it seems cool or popular at the time. If you feel that you have developed a bias towards a user, please run it by an Admin or another Moderator first
* If members are publicly expressing their concerns about a topic which is not appropriate to discuss in a public channel as it may escalate into an uncivil argument or would be better taken up with an admin, then politely inform them that they should take up their concerns with an Administrator or use the reports/suggestion form.
* Don’t punish users as a joke as it may be misinterpreted by them or others as a serious punishment and reflect negatively on the Moderator team
* Interact with the community either with text or voice chat at a pace that is comfortable for you \(say hi, talk about the weather, talk about Warframe, answer a question, post an emote - just remain visible\)
* Deliver punishments that are fair and consistent for all users no matter who breaks our rules
* If you feel like being quiet for a while or need some time off or plan on being away, make sure you post in the \#going-away-board channel on our team server to avoid being demoted for short breaks, vacations, or emergencies
* Avoid talking about activity of other mods - we all have lives outside of warframe / discord and each mod will be able to contribute different hours based on their commitments
* Be a positive example: people will follow your lead, so don't talk down to anyone or contribute to any drama
* Don’t hold your power over people’s heads by bragging, threatening, or scaring them, etc. and don’t use your Moderator position as objective justification for your actions.
* Have fun! While we want you to be professional, we want you to enjoy yourself on our server•    Do not come to us with drama. Keep it off the server. If you have an issue with someone, deal with it in private discussion. If you want to report someone, do it respectfully and speak to an admin or head moderator.
* Avoid guesswork. If you don't know, get help from other guides, look it up, or tell the player you don't know but will look. Misinformation is the enemy of progress. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
DE does a wonderful job of being professionals, having fun, and serving the community and we should follow their example. We're here to put a smile on peoples faces, help them in Warframe, and be a positive force in our community

Please note some of these points overlap with other portions of mod training. If something is repeated - it's because it's important.
