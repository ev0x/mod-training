# Communication

### With Users

Communicating with users in a respectful tone, professional manner, and calm voice is vital to handling a situation and prevent it from becoming a much larger issue.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This section contains help for moderators. **\#mod-bot-spam** is only available to moderators.
{% endhint %}

Follow these guidelines for communicating with users whether in public or private channels - including **\#jade-light** Remember, it is always best to deliver warnings in private and make sure to document warnings with the `!warn` command in **\#mod-bot-spam**. You can check how many warnings a user has with the `!inf search [user]` command.



### Problematic Users

Do your best to be patient with users. Ask questions to cool them down, and be respectful.

Here are some tips for dealing with users:

* Communicate with users in a cool, calm and collected tone
* Remain professional at all times no matter how angry you become
* Start off with the right attitude, if you are feeling drained take a break
* Remember, give users quick, respectful messages that are to the point, honest, and well formulated
* Always provide a reason for any action taken towards a user
* Never use hateful language or do anything to instigate, provoke, or antagonize a user

### De-escalation

* Try to change the topic of the chat to steer the discussion in a positive direction.
* If two or more users have a conflict, urge them to take it to a private group discussion
* Be friendly and ask a user a question unrelated to the current conflict.
* If you are upset, take a break from moderating the chat and address any concerns with Admins
* Read messages carefully so that you know the context and think twice before you type

### Directing Users

{% hint style="info" %}
While we want to enforce our rules, we don't want to be too strict. We want a pleasant, gentle and friendly relationship with our users. If the \#discussion chat is moving slow, some off-topic / general life discussions are fine; however during peak times, make sure to direct people to the appropriate channels and you may send warnings via DM to users who donâ€™t listen.
{% endhint %}

* Direct any suggestions and internal conflicts to our forums at [https://forums.warframe.gg](https://forums.warframe.gg) so our Community Manager can monitor them
* Direct any IT related issues to our Technology Director, iPathos, or Tobiah, or AlexisMachina for light stuff.
* Invite users to the server with [https://discord.gg/warframe](https://discord.gg/warframe) or offer them our info page at [https://warframe.gg](https://warframe.gg)
* Reports can be sent to [https://warframe.gg/report](https://warframe.gg/report) where all admins will be able to review and respond
* Any feedback that is not a suggestion or idea can also be sent using the report page
* Keep **\#discussion** channel Warframe-related, and server issues \(not suggestions\), memes, other topics in **\#off-topic-discussion**; however, you donâ€™t have to be too strict with this rule especially if chat is slow.
* Direct users to apply at our application form pages found in **\#community-news** when the applications are open
* Direct users to **\#spoilers channel** when posting information that hasnâ€™t been available on all platforms for at least 2 weeks on ALL platforms.

### With Admins

The admins each have a general focus of where they operate in their duties, but all are able to be reached to for advice if needed. They may seem daunting to talk to like any one of the current staff members, but we're all here to try and keep the server we enjoy running smoothly.

Please speak to an ðŸ¥’ **active** ðŸ¥’ admin for any emergencies or important discussions relating to the server. Remember to keep any drama or inside jokes away from the server to allow for a professional environment where everyone feels welcome to contribute.

All admins have access to reviewing and responding to reports on [https://wfdiscord.freshdesk.com](https://wfdiscord.freshdesk.com)

The Admins: Lapis, **Misan**, **AlexisMachina**, **Tobiah**, Jakey, **iPathos**
