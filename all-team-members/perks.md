# Perks

Some of the perks that come with the job: 

* **Recognition!** It's not the reason you do what you do, hopefully, but you've earned some recognition for helping. Remember that this also comes with responsibility of living up to what you've been given. This doesn't mean you are better than the players you are helping, and doesn't mean some won't know as much or more than you.
* **Participation!** You're welcome, but not required, to participate in team decisions, and help form the server for the better over time.
* **Team-only giveaways!** From time to time, members of the community donate items that they want us to run giveaways specifically for the team, however the downside is that team members should not participate in the general server giveaways.
* **In-game glyph!** After a short time to make sure you seem like you'll stick around, you're welcome to request a Warframe Community Discord glyph code.
* **Exposure!** You will have many chances to meet new and interesting people, sometimes beyond the scale you would meet as a normal player.
