# Getting Started after Approval

You will be granted the Moderator role on our server after an extensive yet fair process. Please complete Mod Training as soon as possible to keep your permissions or be granted the role.

It is important to take this role seriously and conduct yourself in a professional manner. We are responsible for providing a server that is both safe for work and safe for minors. We are representing the Warframe brand in a prominent way on Discord as we are the largest Warframe server, we are partnered, and we provide a way for the community to discuss content “on the go” and outside of the game. Our Admins are also in direct contact with DE employees.

We realize you are all volunteers and as volunteers you are providing your time. Your time is your greatest asset. As such, we will make sure you are all respected as Moderators and are able to enjoy your time in chat without fear of being bullied, disrespected, made fun of, or harassed in any way. We care about the safety of users, the moderation of the server so people can discuss Warframe wherever they are and making sure people can connect with each other and chat about Warframe content without being drowned out by lewd, vulgar or threatening language.

Please make sure you save your answers if you decide to complete this training another time. You must receive a passing score of 100% in order to complete and pass the Mod Training.
