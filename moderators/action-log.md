# Action Log

{% hint style="info" %}
The **\#action-log** on the warframe discord: https://discord.gg/warframe
{% endhint %}


The first action-log will be auto-logged with Heimdallr when you issue a command with an action towards a user in **\#mod-bot-spam**, or use slowmode. Please make sure to include a reason or add a reason later with `!reason {inf#} {reason}`

{% hint style="danger" %}
IMPORTANT: After using the kick/ban/softban/mute command, make sure the reason shows in **\#action-log**. If it does not show up, you may have to use the `!reason {inf#} {reason}` command to add your reason to the specific case number, so it is documented with `!inf search`.
