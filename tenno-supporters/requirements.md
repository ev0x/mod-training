# Requirements

Help people! It doesn't have to be limited to your position, but please be wary of stepping on another Supporter's toes, especially when you're in their realm. If another Supporter asks you to back off, please respect them and give them a chance to help out.

**Tenno Guides:**  
Simply, help. Sometimes this just means helping a user step through decisions of what to do next in the game, all the way to explaining systems like what a riven is \(in general, you can forward them to \#riven-hub for those questions\) or what the hell status chance is.

**Ranger:**  
You, mighty Ranger, are responsible for helping Eidolon-hunting neophytes take their first steps to glory, as well as assisting in understanding Orb fights on the Vallis. In addition, a general knowledge of how Conservation and fishing will be helpful in answer questions surrounding the open-world areas.

**Riven Guides:**  
The task of the Riven Guide is not a simple or glamorous one. As a Riven Guide, you will have to resist the urge to price rivens that others ask for help with low for your own benefit, as well as staying impartial when someone asks for a price check so that they get a fair deal. The market shifts constantly, so and there is no true absolute price, so sending users towards sites such as riven.market is sometimes inevitable just so they can make an easier sale.   
At the same time, the channel, riven-hub, is often ridden with members who wish to make your or others lives harder. You don't have to deal with them being like this, and are encouraged to call in a mod, but if you have rapport with the user, and can get them to calm down without mod involvement, more power to you.

**Tenno Builders:**  
As experts of different builds for general or specialized circumstances, your help is needed to aid players in viewing more than a single facet of a weapon, Warframe, ability, utility, or even random mechanic in-game. There is often an underlying atmosphere pervading the channel and discussion of builds, due to the in-game meta. If that is all you know, you are encouraged to see other pathways to what the player you're helping is seeking, even if it isn't the most efficient. That said, you are not asked to ignore your instincts or abilities, simply to direct and apply them as is needed by the player you are helping.
