# Punishments

Below we'll go through some of the punishments we hand out when users break our rules, policies and/or Warframe and Discord Terms of Use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mods and admins can use `!unban` and `!unmute` to remove a punishment if it has been appealed or if there was a mistake. We will also discuss the appeal process below.

Admins can `!inf delete` to remove an infraction from a user's record, as well.
{% endhint %}

In extreme cases, members can be server muted via the UI \(example: during events\); however, please make sure this is logged in our team server \(**\#action-log**\) with the user's Discord ID \(not username\).

Please remember that after this training we fully expect you to use the bot commands, and we expect you to document actions taken in \#action-log , so that other Mods are aware you have handled a specific issue.

If you would like to search for a past case, go to \#mod-bot-spam and type in

`!inf search`

When a user breaks a rule, it's important to have the right attitude and mindset. Remember, people join our server from different regions of the world, have faced different experiences, and may be different than you. Some may need to be treated more assertively and others with a delicate touch but punishments should be consistent for all users. It is up to you to learn how to strike this balance and it comes with time and experience.

When you are granted Moderator, you have access to these bot commands so please use them carefully, infrequently, and only when absolutely necessary.

Follow the guidelines below on when and how to use bot commands along with some examples. We are trusting you with a major responsibility. We are the guardians of a server for a game that is recognized around the world, a game that brings joy to players, a game that developers support their families and make a living from, a game that brings people together from all walks of life.
