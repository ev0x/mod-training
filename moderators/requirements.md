# Requirements

* Do not leak any staff sensitive information to those who it is not appropriate to discuss with. For example, NEVER screenshot \#moderators and send it to non-Moderators.
* Must be professional and deal with users respectfully. No bullying or harassment towards users or other mods.
* Must be registered on our forums, so you can provide information when requested on ban appeals.
* Must use bot commands when delivering punishments, so it is properly logged. Casual warnings via voice chat do not need to be logged if the user stops; however, additional warnings via voice chat need to be logged with !warn command.
* Must show respect to admins. You can offer feedback as long as it is done in the right attitude and professionally. Flaming /raging at an admin may have you removed from your role.
* Must be willing to give punishments even when it may not be the popular thing to do.
* Must follow our server rules, Warframe Terms and Discord Terms of Use.
* Must maintain activity within either voice or text chat. At least 50 messages posted per month so we know you're still around, watching chat and interacting.
* Do not start arguments with fellow Mods or Admins in public or private chats. If there is any tension, deal with it calmly and take it to a private discussion before jumping back into moderation.
