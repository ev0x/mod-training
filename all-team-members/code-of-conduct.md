# Code of Conduct

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note some of these points overlap with other portions of mod training. If something is repeated - it's because it's important.
{% endhint %}

* Remain neutral and professional. Avoid judging or shaming others in public.
* Be kind and respectful towards everyone especially when resolving conflict.
* Be understanding, but don’t be afraid to enforce rules if chat is getting out of hand.
* Do not publicly insult anyone, be rude or hateful towards them even if you kick or ban them.
* Avoid picking favorites; even if your friend breaks a rule in our policy. Treat everyone fairly.
* Don’t be afraid to give users proper punishment if they do not listen even if they are popular in chat and even if the action is not the popular thing to do. When in doubt, discuss in \#moderators.
* Don’t abuse your Mod powers by breaking our policy or randomly kicking / banning others.
* Swearing is allowed if it’s not excessive; however, please swear as little as possible so you can set a good example to others. By abusing rules or using profane language, others may copy you.
* Please avoid sacrificing your own personal welfare to moderate the chat. This is community service. If you’re the only Mod available and you must attend to personal or professional life, you are free to leave and you can post a quick note in \#moderators or in our \#going-away-board. Moderating is a volunteer service you should enjoy. Real life always comes first and we will never hold that against you.
* Welcome new members and if you have time, answer any questions they may have.
* Be respectful of other Admins and Moderators and if you have any constructive feedback, please give the feedback kindly in a private message.
* Do your best to keep channels on topic during peak hours. When the chat is slow, you can allow some off-topic conversation in \#discussion as long as it is not disruptive.
* If someone is testing you as a Moderator, ignore them and do not fuel the flames. If it continues, send them a gentle warning and let them know it will not be tolerated.
* Don’t be afraid to hop into voice chat from time to time, to either listen in or interact with users.
* If you have time, feel free to help new players in-game and give them some direction.
* If you’d like to report another Mod, please PM an admin directly. Do not start drama. Keep drama off the server.
* If there is any illegal activity, including threats of violence, constant cyber bullying, threats of homicide or suicide, or any other illegal activity being discussed, report it to Discord at [abuse@discordapp.com](mailto:abuse@discordapp.com) and let the Admins know about it as soon as you are aware of it.
* Never disagree with another Admin or Mod in public. Take it to a private discussion between yourself and the other staff member\(s\).
* Don’t let yourself get dragged into drama or craziness in chat. Be the better person, ignore it, change the overall topic, let things cool down and if necessary, issue any warnings privately. If drama continues, mute anyone involved or take any other necessary actions.
* Remember to take breaks from Moderating if you’ve been online and watching or chatting for a while. You are a volunteer here to support the Warframe community, not an employee.
* Resist the urge to respond to a troll fishing for a reaction from you. If you must, respond in PM.
* If someone invites a bot without Admin permission, you are free to ban the bot temporarily especially if it’s an automated spambot.
* Most important guideline is LISTEN. The best Mods are those who listen more than they talk.
