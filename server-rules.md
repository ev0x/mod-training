# Server Rules

1. If a staff member tells you not to do something, don't do it.
2. Keep content to its respective channel. Keep the \#discussion channel Warframe related, server-specific issues belong in \#off-topic-discussion, \#off-topic-discussion for discussions, pictures that donâ€™t have another place in the server, and memes. The rules still apply in all of these places, and this rule is a reinforcement of common sense.
3. Keep bot commands within \#botspam.
4.  Be polite and respect each other. Slurs, excessive profanity, harassment, sexism, racism, bullying, obscene, politically-charged, and sexual content will not be tolerated. This applies to all posted content in addition to voice chat, usernames, and avatars. Usernames should be pingable, meaning zalgo or other characters that interfere with pinging the user or disrupt chat should be removed, or a nickname applied if those characters are in the username. **On the internet, NSFW \(not safe for work\) is used to mark URLs and hyperlinks which link to videos and other pages containing nudity, intense sexuality, profanity, violence, gore and/or other potentially disturbing subject matter, which the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at in a public or formal environment, including a workplace or school.**
5. Only ping the Moderator role when necessary.
6. Do not spam. If a moderator thinks it's spam, it's spam.
7. Do not expose the personal information of any member of this server without their consent, in public or private. This is an immediately-bannable offense.
8. Do not impersonate other users, especially staff and developers.
9. If lore-related content has not been released longer than 2 weeks on ALL platforms, it belongs in \#spoilers-and-lore \(join by reacting with ![:regional\_indicator\_a:](https://canary.discordapp.com/assets/9d3334bc4be7f586fc00eb2772eb331f.svg)  in \#joinables on the appropriate message\).
10. Do not post datamined content.
11. Keep recruiting, trading, \#riven-hub, \#creative-content in their respective channels. Squad recruitment is allowed in platform-specific squad-recruiting channels.
12. Do not ping the developers. Not only is it rude, but they won't respond to you here anyway. You'll have better luck on Twitter or the Forums.
13. Do not trash the staff of this server or Digital Extremes.
14. Do not post content that breaks rules and delete it immediately after. We saw it and we have logs.
15. No backseat moderating. Let our staff handle the server, and only ping the moderators when necessary. If you have any issues, message a moderator or submit a report \(with the `!report` command\).
16. Do not advertise for other discord servers. If you need a discord link posted, ask a moderator.
17. Do not use our server to violate the Terms of Use for either Warframe \([https://www.warframe.com/terms](https://www.warframe.com/terms)\) or Discord \([https://discordapp.com/terms](https://discordapp.com/terms)\).
18. Group chats for 4 persons in Squad Up - Voice are not public chats. If you don't know someone in one, or are not in a squad with an existing group, don't intrude on a group. It is impolite and disruptive. Voice changers are fine in private with friends, not in public or when asked to stop.
19. This server is primarily for English speaking users. We have several partnered servers that are made specifically for those of other primary languages. However, if you are in a voice chat with others who speak your language, feel free to hang out with them. All other rules still apply.
